Other browser support?
- Brave, Vivaldi and other chromium browsers that use the Google Chrome Web Store for installing extensions.
- Opera's review process is VERY slow. To be sure you're running a more recent version install via the Google Chrome Web Store instead using "Add to Opera"! [More info](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/)
- Firefox for Android, is technically supported, but I do not test for compatibility.
- Edge will be supported when the Chromium builds become the official stable release. When running beta builds you can also install from the Chrome Web Store after enabling instalation from other stores.
- Safari is unsupported.
