Other browser support?
- Brave, Vivaldi and other chromium browsers that use the Google Chrome Web Store for installing extensions.
- Opera's review process is VERY slow. To be sure you're running a more recent version install via the Google Chrome Web Store instead using "Add to Opera"! [More info](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/)
- Firefox for Android, is technically supported, but I do not test for compatibility.
- Safari is unsupported.
